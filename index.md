###  Instructions After Writing

1. Save this content as `index.md` in your GitHub repository.
2. Add a profile picture at `./images/profile.jpg` or update the path accordingly.
3. Enable GitHub Pages via your repo settings:
   - Go to `Settings` > `Pages`
   - Choose the branch and folder (usually `main` and `/root`)
   - GitHub will provide a link like `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`
4. Add the published URL to your `README.md` file like this:

```markdown

Here’s a snippet of Python I love:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
